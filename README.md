ðŸ”­ My expertise spans a range of backend stacks including Node.js, Nest.js, CodeIgniter, GraphQL, and Django. I'm also well-versed in a number of frontend frameworks like React, Next.js, and Angular.
ðŸ”­ I'm a skilled mobile app developer, with a specialization in React Native.
ðŸ”­ I have extensive experience with AWS services like Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, ECS, EKS, S3, Cloudfront, Lambda, RDS, VPC, IAM, and ECR.
ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm learning about some exciting new technologies like GitHub Actions, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, and Blockchain.
ðŸ”­ When it comes to databases, I've worked extensively with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
